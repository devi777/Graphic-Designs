# Graphic-Designs
Some event posters &amp; graphic wallpapers that I designed for, well sheer fun! I have a keen interest in graphic design, so I keep giving time to this hobby of mine and try to kick my creativity out on them.

Also, I worked as a Graphic Designer under my college's JUIT Youth Club (JYC). Got involved in making several inivitational posters, promotional videos and sports dropdowns for the events held from August 2018 to July 2019 (1 year).
